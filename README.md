# Twine - Sustainable Clothing E-Commerce App

Twine is a sustainable clothing e-commerce app built with React Native using Expo.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Expo CLI
- Git

You can install Expo CLI globally by running:

`npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn add global expo-cli` if you're using `yarn`

### Installing

Follow these steps to get a development environment running:

1. **Clone the repository**

`git clone git@github.com:kmiller9393/twine.git && cd twine`

2. **Install dependencies**

`npm install` or `yarn install` if you're using `yarn`

3. **Start the Expo development server**

`npx expo start`

This command will open up a browser window with the Expo developer tools. You can then run the app on an iOS simulator, Android emulator, or directly on your mobile device using the Expo Go app by scanning the QR code displayed in the terminal or Expo developer tools.

### Running on iOS Simulator

- Press `i` in the terminal where your Expo dev server is running.

### Running on Android Emulator

- Press `a` in the terminal where your Expo dev server is running.
